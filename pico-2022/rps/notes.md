# Notes
- "If we win 5 times something good happens" aka get flag
- Seeded with current time

- If computer plays:
  - 0 -> we play paper
  - 1 -> we play scissors
  - 2 -> we play rock

# Writeup
Seeding from time is bad
We can generate it's moves and play directly against it
with a high chance of success
